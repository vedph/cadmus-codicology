# Codicology Decorations

üîë ID: `it.vedph.codicology.decorations`

Essential description of the decorations found in a manuscript. This is a relatively synthetic, yet highly granular description, thus included in a single part rathern than being an item.

Each decoration has some generic metadata (ID, name and features), date and/or place, artist(s), references, and any number of elements.

Each element has a more detailed set of descriptive metadata, and can also be positioned in an elements hierarchy shaped like a tree, where each element can have one parent and any number of children. An element has type, features, range(s) covered by it in the manuscript, typologies, subject, colors, gildings, techniques and tools, positions in the page, reference sign, height, relation with text, free text description, and zero or more images.

## Thesauri

The decorations part uses some thesauri to dynamically update its UI according to data being entered. The core thesaurus here is üìö `cod-decoration-element-types`, required, which defines the types of decoration elements, such as initial pages, illustrations, headletters, paragraphematic signs, etc.

The UI structure is hierarchical:

- list of decorations:
  - edited decoration:
    - ID, name, features (üìö `cod-decoration-flags`), note, chronotopes, references, artists, list of elements:
      - edited element

In the edited elements, when the edited element type is selected from the list of element types:

- all the thesauri entries (except for `cod-decoration-type-hidden`, which is a settings thesaurus) are filtered according to the selected type. To this end, the IDs of these thesauri follow the syntax of hierarchical thesauri, e.g. `par.rubrication` is the entry for "rubrication" which must be displayed only when the element type is `par`.
- some areas of the UI are hidden according to the selected type. To this end, the üìö `cod-decoration-type-hidden` thesaurus contains a list of identifiers from `cod-decoration-element-types`, each having as value a space-delimited list of tokens. In this thesaurus, each token represents a portion of the UI which should be hidden when that element type is selected. For instance, the paragraphematic type has ID `par` in the types thesaurus; in the hidden thesaurus, an entry has `par` as its ID, and `subject textRelation lineHeight` as its value. The value contains 3 UI portions to hide, each identified by a name.

The portions which can be hidden are:

- flags
- typologies
- subject
- colors
- gildings
- techniques
- tools
- positions
- lineHeight
- textRelation
- refSign
